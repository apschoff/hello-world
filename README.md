My first repository on github

My name is Austin Schoff. I am soon to graduate Claremont McKenna College where I will be receiving
my Bachelor's in Economics and my Master's in Finance. I am a statistics nerd and avid sports fan,
with hockey and baseball being my two favorites. Outside of school, I am passionate about data science,
databates cleaning and manipulaton, and big data programming. I have worked for the Milwaukee Brewers and
Econ One as a Statistical Analyst, and I will be starting as a PMG Analyst for Hall Capital Partners in
San Francisco in July.

Three things I enjoy:

<ul> 
<li> The LA Kings </li>
<li> Playing Jazz Music </li>
<li>Traveling, especially internationally </li>
</ul>
